# My artistic work

Website to show my artistic work.

This is my first static website created at 2013 without JavaScript.

I started to learn programmation with this website.

It needs a total refont to use web components and improve the UX but it but it gives a glimpse of my artistic work and my evolution in the code comparing the next repositories.
